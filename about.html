            <p>I am currently a student at both Great Bay Community College and the University of New Hampshire, studying computer science. I have always had an interest in technology, starting at a very early age and never really deviating from it. I especially enjoy programming, which is my main focus, but I have experience in many different areas including web design and networking. There are a few things that made me want to pursue programming. I love the challenge and problem solving that comes with writing a program, and the satisfaction at the end when you finally get a program working just how you intended it to. I also beleive that the sky is the limit in terms of what you can create, which makes for an always growing and worthwhile career.</p>

            <p>I grew up in the Exeter area of New Hampshire, the youngest of three kids, moving many times at a young age but always in the surrounding towns. I currently live in Brentwood, NH. Growing up, I was active in many sports; mainly baseball for a number of years, but I also enjoy basketball and bowling. In my free time you can find me either behind a computer screen working on a program or going out for some karaoke.</p>
            
            <p>Please visit my <a href="projects.html">project page</a> to see some of my work, and <a href="pdf/resume.pdf">my resume</a> is available online.</p><p>I'm also happy to provide references, one of which is provided as <a href="pdf/LoR.pdf">a letter in PDF</a>.</p>
