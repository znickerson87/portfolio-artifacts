<h1><center>About Me</h1>
<img src="me2.jpg" height="50%" width="30%" align="left">
<p><i>My name is Zach Nickerson. I am a current student at Great Bay Community College as well as the University of New Hampshire, studying computer science. 
	  I have always had an interest in technology, starting at a very early age and never really deviating from it. I especially enjoy programming,
	  which is my main focus but have experience in many different areas including web design and networking. There are a few things that made me want to pursue
 	  programming. I love the challenge and problem solving that comes with writing a program, and the satisfaction at the end when you finally get a program
	  working just how you intended it to. I also beleive that the sky is the limit in terms of what you can create which makes for an always growing and worthwhile 
	  career. </i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>I grew up in the Exeter area of New Hampshire, moving many times at a young age but always in the surrounding towns, and am the youngest out of three kids. 
	  I currently live in Brentwood, NH. Growing up I played a lot of sports, mainly baseball for years, but also basketball and bowling. In my free time you can find me either 
	  behind a computer screen working on a program or going out for some karaoke.</i></p>
